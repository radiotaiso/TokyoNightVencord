# Tokyo Night

![](https://github.com/radiotaiso/TokyoNightVencord/blob/main/assets/preview.png?raw=true)

Authors keep deleting and moving their nice work so I forked my favorite, there are other tools like betterdiscord that can work with this but idk, I use vencord.

## Installation

Install Vencord
```bash
sh -c "$(curl -sS https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Vendicated/VencordInstaller/main/install.sh)"
```

Go to Vencord > Themes > Online Themes and paste the following line:
```bash

```
